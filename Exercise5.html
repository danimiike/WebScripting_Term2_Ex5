            /* Your answer to question 2 below goes underneath the question
            
                1. Submit a screen shot of the Chrome debugger console showing the
                   console.log output.
    
                2. Explanation of how the output is generated; i.e.
                   How does the code work starting from line 17 and finishing with
                   the completion of line 1?
                   
                   ANSWER:
                   In the line 17 obj.prop.getFullName() calls the function getFullName (line 11) 
                   and it returns the local/function variable which is “Jim Cooper”.  
                   In line 18 getFullname does not calls the function it gets the global attribute, 
                   that is this.fullName = “Garth Santor”.
